# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary DataFrame of ride sharing data by city type and create a graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type. These three city types Urban, Suburban, and Rural. The data differs by city type which can help PyBer make business decisions regarding these differences.

## Results
The summary DataFrame can be seen below:

From these results, we can see that we have the least amount of drivers and rides in rural areas, while the most are located in urban areas. Meanwhile, the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver is highest in rural areas. We can assume that this is because there is not a lot of drivers in rural cities compared to the amount in urban cities. There is higher demand for rides and drivers where more people are located (urban areas).

The multiple line chart I created can be seen below:

The chart above is a multiple line chart which compares Total Fare by City Type from January to April 2019. Once again, we can see here that there is less demand for rides in rural cities than there is in urban cities. 

## Summary
Three business recommendations for the CEO:
1. PyBer drivers should be assigned to work in the area that they live in. It wouldn't make sense for a driver who lives in an urban city to be driving all the way to a rural area for rides. 
2. Fares should be increased during "peak" hours that customers need rides: going to work in the morning, rush hour, and late on weekends. 
3. Fares can also be increased on holidays when drivers do not have to necessarily be working.
